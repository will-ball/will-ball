I'm a Chancellor's Fellow at the Robert Gordon University. I'm a social epidemiologist researching population pealth using health records and administrative data sources. My work is mainly focused on better understanding health inequalities so that we can develop or evaluate policy aimed at reducing them. I'm also interested in applying counterfactual causal inference methods.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an a project exploring the effect of recent treatment in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services on the risk of presenting to hospital in a mental health crisis. This work is generously funded by the [NHS Grampian Endowment Fund](https://www.nhsgcharities.com/grants/community-grants-programme/)
